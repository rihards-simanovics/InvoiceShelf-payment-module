### Hard Stops

- InvoiceShelf >= 1.3.0 (upgrade this module to 1.1.0)

## Development

This is a step by step guide on how to get started, with development.

### Prerequisites

1. nvm/fnm (optional)
2. Node JS: `20 LTS`
3. `yarn`

### Steps

1. Clone the [InvoiceShelf repo](https://github.com/InvoiceShelf/InvoiceShelf) - needed for the admin components. In the future it's likely to be just a node package and you wont need this step.
2. Create `Modules/` dir, in the root dir.
3. Clone this repo into `Payments/` dir inside `/Modules/`.
4. Initialise `node_modules` by running `yarn` inside `/` of the InvoiceShelf repo.
5. Initialise `node_modules` by running `yarn` inside `/Modules/Payments/` of this repo.
6. Make the changes you wish to make.
7. Run `yarn build`, new `/Modules/Payments/dist/` dir will be created with built `css` and `js` bundles.
8. Upload the contents of `/Modules/Payments/` to your server with InvoiceShelf. Either use SFTP or zip up the folder.
9. Continue from [Installation (Step 2)](#installation)

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an empty popup when adding a new payment provider you need to clear your `cache`, `cookies`, and/or `site data` as specified in [Installation (Step 6)](#installation)
